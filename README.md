UMich Engr100 Section Checker
=============================
Checks availibility of ENGR100 sections at U of M.
Built with Qt.

Given a link to the LSA course guide page of the wanted course
  and filling in the class numbers that you want to monitor,
  this program will check every X seconds to see if the section
  has opened up or not. Check interval is user defined.

Not pretty code, I wanted to throw it together as fast as possible to use myself.
